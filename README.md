# GIMME Preprocessing Scripts

This set of scripts were used for preparing resting state functional MRI data for analysis using Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation (GIMME) analysis. They should roughly be used in the order in which they're numbered. Quality control scripts are marked with a QC. These will by no means cover all of the quality control checks needed, but they are helpful. 

These scripts were developed by/with Adriene Beltz, Hailey Dotterer, and Leigh Goetschius.
